          Ads are served according to pacing and bidding algorithms, and at LinkedIn I was tasked with optimizing the way
          certain ads were delivered. As an intern, I first created numerous queries and set up a Jupyter Notebook to conduct data analysis,
          and from the data analyzed I devised a new component of a bidding algorithm. After comprehensive testing, we were able
          to ship this to production. Affected ads saw increases in revenue and budget utilization, as well as a decrease in over delivery.

          While interning for the Amazon Web Services Simple Queue Service (AWS SQS) team, I was responsible for investigating
          and diagnosing bottlenecks in our testing methodology, then consolidating the data into a user draft proposal. 
          By utilizing Ruby scripts, as well as various internal template tools, I shortened test rig production time by
          400% (20 days to 5 days) and saved $1000+ per subsequent test rig deployment.

          Working in an Agile environment for my first internship, I migrated key components of our codebase
          from AngularJS to Angular6+. I also spearheaded the design and creation of new features, such as customizable audio
          visualizers, a centralized keypress shortcut service, and a media marker/segment management system. These additions,
          along with many UI revisions, were geared towards an optimized Data Asset Management suite.
